Project for practicing layout utilizing CSS Grid. Part of TOP intermediate HTML and CSS.

I am calling it done for now. It looks fine statically for a small window, which is what i created it for. It is only partially dynamic and looks bad in fullscreen. Still, i got to practice layout with grid and i learned a lot, which i will remember for next time. So i move on for now.
